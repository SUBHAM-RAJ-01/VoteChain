> 🚧 **Project Status: Under Active Development** - Started August 2025

A secure, transparent, and decentralized electronic voting platform built on Ethereum blockchain technology. VoteChain eliminates traditional voting vulnerabilities by providing tamper-proof vote storage, real-time results, and complete transparency while maintaining voter anonymity.

## 🌟 Key Features (Planned)

- 🔒 **Blockchain Security** - Immutable vote recording on Ethereum
- ⚡ **Real-time Results** - Live vote counting and analytics
- 🌐 **Web-based Platform** - Responsive design for all devices
- 💰 **Cost-effective** - Free hosting and testnet implementation
- 🔐 **Secure Authentication** - JWT with MetaMask wallet integration
- 📊 **Transparent Analytics** - Public verification tools
- 🛡️ **Anti-fraud Protection** - Prevents double voting and manipulation

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

**Frontend:** React.js, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Web3.js  
**Backend:** Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB Atlas  
**Blockchain:** Solidity, Hardhat, Polygon Mumbai Testnet
